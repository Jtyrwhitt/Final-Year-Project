        <h1>Comments</h1>
        <p class="mb-5">A comment is a part of the code that is not executed. It serves to provide explanations or context to make the code easier to understand. In Python, comments begin with the # symbol and continue until the end of the line.</p>
        
        <h3>Single line comments</h3>
        <p>In Python, comments are initiated with the # symbol, and everything following it on that line is considered part of the comment until the line ends.</p>

        <h3>Multi line comments</h3>
        <p>Python does not have a dedicated syntax for multi-line comments like some other languages. Instead, you can use multiple # symbols, one for each line, to create comments spanning multiple lines.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, multi-line strings (using triple quotes """) can be used as a workaround for multi-line comments. These strings are ignored by Python when not assigned to a variable, effectively serving as comments.</p>
